# Philadelphia-COVID-19-Vaccination-Database
<b> (1) Project Summary </b>

The Philadelphia Covid Vaccination Database tracks vaccination rates in the city of Philadelphia.  With our database we can assist the Philadelphia Department of Public Health (PDPH) in tracking COVID-19 vaccine administration data in the city of Philadelphia. Patient demographic information, the pre-existing conditions of different patient populations, insurance information, vaccine adverse reactions, and other information related to vaccination sites and vaccine administration is captured in our database.  

Specific demographic and area information can be produced from our database for all residents of the city of Philadelphia. Consequently, these reports can be utilized by the Philadelphia Department of Public Health for targeted ad campaigns in hopes of improving vaccination rates in the city. Additionally, the patient pre-existing conditions can help to determine priority of distribution for new vaccines to particularly vulnerable groups. The Philadelphia Covid Vaccination Database can also produce reports about specific vaccination sites in the city, including which ones are receiving the most traffic, and which licensed medical professionals are helping to vaccinate the most patients. Additionally, our database will be able to track patient adverse reactions to the vaccine made by each of the vaccine manufacturers. This information can again be utilized by PDPH for public awareness about common reactions to the vaccine to help increase transparency and trust in the city’s COVID-19 vaccination campaign. Finally, we also track vaccine manufacturer sites and vaccine shipments to ensure quality control in vaccine doses and document vaccine costs on the individual vaccination site level for future budgets and resource allocation.  

As the COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing and continues to be a dynamic situation, this database has been designed with flexibility in mind. There is no limit on the maximum number of vaccine doses patients may receive, as new booster shots continue to be made available to the public. Additionally, we have opted to track anyone who has received a vaccine within the city of Philadelphia, not just registered residents. This helps to determine allocation of resources and could be important when coordinating vaccination efforts with other departments of public health in surrounding areas.

<b> (2) Project Statement </b>

<b> 2.1 Overall Goals of the System </b>

- This project is a COVID-19 vaccine database system designed for the city of Philadelphia. The system will store information regarding vaccine administration to depict vaccination levels within the different locales of Philadelphia. The goal of this system is to assist the Philadelphia Department of Public Health in tracking COVID-19 vaccine administration data in the city of Philadelphia, patient demographic information, the pre-existing conditions of different patient populations, vaccine adverse reactions, and other information related to vaccination sites and vaccine administration.  

 

<b> 2.2 Context and Importance of the System </b>

- Many people within the United States still refuse to get vaccinated against COVID-19, while others still have not received the full COVID-19 vaccine regimen. According to the CDC, only 80% of the eligible US population has received 1 COVID-19 vaccine dose, while only 68.2% have completed their primary series (CDC, 2020). Creating one system that tracks patient vaccination data across different patient demographics would allow for a coordinated effort across different Philadelphia Department of Public Health divisions to create public health campaigns for COVID-19 vaccination and increase vaccination rates within the city. 
- Because we have opted to also track individual vaccine administrators and vaccination site data in this system, we would be able to see which vaccination sites and their employees were most successful in vaccinating their patient populations and identify these sites as clinics of interest to study. Additionally, we would be able to track which vaccines are received the most by patients (Pfizer, Moderna, J&J, etc.), potentially helping the city of Philadelphia to make informed purchasing decisions of vaccines. The system we have designed would also help the city of Philadelphia with mandatory reporting on COVID-19 vaccination information to state and national level government entities. 

 

<b> 2.3 Scope of the Project  </b>

<b> 2.3.1 In-Scope </b>

- This system will store data about patients in the city of Philadelphia (regardless of whether they have received a vaccine dose or not), patient pre-existing conditions, patient adverse reactions to vaccines, and the insurance plans of patients. We will store data about patients’ vaccination status, which could be either vaccinated, partially vaccinated, fully vaccinated, fully vaccinated with a single booster, or fully vaccinated with a double booster, and their vaccination card record. 
- We will also store data about individual vaccine doses and their manufacturers and the shipment the vaccines were received in. Finally, we will track data about where vaccine doses were administered and who administered the dose to each patient.  

<b> 2.3.2 Out-of-Scope </b>

- This system will only store data on patients who were vaccinated within the city of Philadelphia, not Philadelphia residents who have been vaccinated at other sites outside of the city limits. This system also will not store information regarding billing insurance companies for vaccines nor total costs associated with purchasing and administering vaccines. Additionally, this database does not track reporting of adverse events experienced by patients after vaccination to the manufacturing company. 

 

<b> 2.4 Related systems and any open-source tools  </b>

- This project was inspired by the COVID-19 vaccination information depicted on the Philadelphia Department of Public Health’s website (Vaccine data | Programs and initiatives). Additionally, a related system called PhilaVax, run by the City of Philadelphia, tracks Philadelphia citizen vaccination data for all diseases (Philavax). Finally, this system could be used to report to the Pennsylvania Department of Health’s COVID-19 Vaccine Dashboard (COVID-19 Vaccine Dashboard.). We designed the Entity Relationship Diagram using the https://app.diagrams.net/  open source tool.
